        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm a casual geek and a professional nerd. Since I was a young lad, I was fascinated by computers. Gaming was my biggest passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am an intern for SA International helping develop their Flexi product. I am currently attending the University of Utah's Full Stack Development coding bootcamp and doing well so far. Besides that, my experience largely comes from solving various computer issues for myself and my family, making old games work on newer machines/operating systems, and applying modifications to certain games like Skyrim and Oblivion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm detail-oriented. I'm persistent. I rarely get angry or frustrated. I'm a logical thinker. I'm intuitive. I have lots of expertise in and passion for computers. Take a look at my work and let me know if you're interested in my services.
